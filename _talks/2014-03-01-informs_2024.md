This is a description of your conference proceedings talk, note the different field in type. You can put anything in this field.Cancers are a growing cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Geographic access plays a key role in both treatment and diagnosis  - however a dearth of existing facilities often means that the demand for cancer services is not well understood. Using Rwanda as a case study, we adopt a distributionally robust optimization approach to simultaneously identify existing burdens and maximize access to treatment. First, we present a novel-path based formulation of two stage decision problem. In this problem&apos;s first stage a decision maker must simultaneously choose a set of facilities at which to add a set of tertiary cancer services and design a transportation network to improve patient access. In the second stage, patients use the transportation network to seek care at the place facilities. We then extend this formulation to instances in which demand is unknown and present preliminary work on solving large scale instances of this problem using Branch and Price and strengthening cuts.
