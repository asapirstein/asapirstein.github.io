Improving Equity in Healthcare Access Through Network Design: A Case Study of Specialist Cancer Care in Rwanda	Talk	informs_healthcare_2023	Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences Healthcare Confrence	2023-07-28	Toronto ON, CA		Cancer is a growing cause of death in Rwanda. Addressing inequity in access to cancer care requires policy solutions that consider cost, demand for care, provider availability, and barriers to healthcare access. In this talk, we consider an important barrier to access - poor road conditions that lead to long travel times to access specialist cancer care in Rwanda. We formulate a network design problem that considers road improvements and facility expansion simultaneously. We parameterize the model using publicly available data and propose solutions that align with the objectives of government and NGO partners.
Paving the Way for More Accessible Cancer Care in Low-Income Countries with Optimization	Talk	informs_2025	Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences Annual Confrence	2025-10-27	Atlanta GA, USA		Cancers are a growing cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. Geographic access plays a key role in both timely diagnosis and successful treatment. In areas lacking well-developed road networks, seasonal weather events can lengthen already long travel times to access care. Expanding facilities to offer cancer care is expensive and requires staffing by skilled medical professionals, which are often in short supply. In this article, we propose a mathematical model to improve geographic access to cancer care by jointly considering expansions to care facilities and improvements to the road network. We model this as a multi-period stochastic facility location network design problem. In each period, a decision maker must simultaneously choose a set of facilities at which to add tertiary cancer services and a set of roads to improve while facing demand and travel time uncertainty. Once demand for cancer care and weather events are realized, patients observe road conditions and use the transportation network to travel towards the closed facility with available cancer services. We create a new path-based formulation of this problem and develop a new branch-price-and-cut algorithm with acceleration techniques that take advantage of this formulationâ€™s structure. We demonstrate our approach using Rwanda as a case study and show that the reductions in travel time to cancer care that are directly attributable to the road network improvements can be as high as 1 hour.

Designing Tertiary Cancer Services Under Burden Uncertainty	Talk	informs_2024	Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences Annual Confrence	2014-03-01	Seattle WA, USA		 You can put anything in this field.Cancers are a growing cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Geographic access plays a key role in both treatment and diagnosis  - however a dearth of existing facilities often means that the demand for cancer services is not well understood. Using Rwanda as a case study, we adopt a distributionally robust optimization approach to simultaneously identify existing burdens and maximize access to treatment. First, we present a novel-path based formulation of two stage decision problem. In this problem's first stage a decision maker must simultaneously choose a set of facilities at which to add a set of tertiary cancer services and design a transportation network to improve patient access. In the second stage, patients use the transportation network to seek care at the place facilities. We then extend this formulation to instances in which demand is unknown and present preliminary work on solving large scale instances of this problem using Branch and Price and strengthening cuts.
