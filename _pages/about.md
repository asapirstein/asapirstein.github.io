I am a PhD student at the [H Milton Stewart School of Industrial Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) studying **Operations Research**.
I want to ask (and eventually answer) questions about equity in healthcare systems, both domestically and globally. These questions fall into a few general categories: 
* **Public Policy Impact**: is a particular policy (say the Affordable Care Act's Community Benefit clause) having its desired impact? What do we believe the impact of a new policy will be? Can we optimize a particular policy goal? 
* **Economic Incentive Alignment**: How can we provide financial incentives to encourage optimal care seeking behavior among patients or optimal prescriber behavior? Can economic incentives be used to impact desired policy goals? 
* **Future Cognizant Decision Support**: How can we make healthcare providers lives easier, while encouraging system design that accounts for predicted population changes and climate change? 


Answering these questions will requires the technical horizons of Operations Research. I am eagerly working on these horizons. Currently, I am supported National Defence Science and Engineering (NDSEG) graduate fellowship. I've been lucky thus far to have received support from the Watson Foundation, Ernst & Young, the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research at Georgia Institute of Technology, and INFORMS. Along the way I've had awesome mentors open doors in the wonderful world of OR for me, including, [Sommer Gentry](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/sommer-e-gentry), [Susan Martonosi](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/martonosi/), [Reza Kalhor](https://kalhorlab.bme.jhu.edu/), and my doctoral advisor, [Lauren Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/). 


I was away from Georgia Tech from August 2022 - August 2023 as a [Thomas J Watson Fellow](https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj) exploring international perspectives and solutions in reducing disparities in access to healthcare and healthcare system quality. A considerable amount of . On fellowship, I spent a few months in each Kigali, Santiago, and Oslo before coming back to Georgia Tech. My experience as a Watson Fellow was incredibly impactful and shapes the questions, both applied and technical, that I ask.

My technical research centers around using large-scale optimization techniques to improve how we make resource-allocation healthcare decisions under both uncertainty and ambiguity. 


Previously, I was an undergrad at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. While there I studied **math and computational biology** and graduated with distinction and CS departmental honors. Mudd provided me with the opportunity to build broad foundations, ranging from basic chemistry and biology into advanced mathematics and physics. It also allowed me the freedom to work on a couple research projects that were essential in leading me to OR. Detailed information is available in my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume/). 

While at Mudd, I was also a varsity swimmer for Claremont-Mudd-Scripps - go Stagthenas! I swam distance events and take some of my outlook from the pool. I continue to fill my free time with cardio whenever possible, but have expanded it to include running and riding bikes.
